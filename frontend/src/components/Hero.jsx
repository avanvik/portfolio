				<p>I am an interaction designer and I do most of my work in projects between the early prototype stage and final
				implementation. I love to work in highly technical, multi-diciplinary teams, and I try to keep my skillset wide.
				Currently I'm experimenting with real-time 3D rendering, VR, animation and all sorts of digital prototyping.</p>
				<p>Sometimes I work on with side-projects in Unity or Unreal Engine. I teach what I know to my peers, and
				occasionally I do talks and workshops at conferences.</p>
